* Introduction
This is the primary repo for the Coding Temple Module _Advanced JavaScript and Introduction to React._

* Project - Fake Store App

** Objective:
In this project, you will build a FakeStore E-Commerce App using React, React Router, and FakeStoreAPI. Your app will allow users to view, create, update, and delete products dynamically using API calls. This project reinforces state management, API interactions, React Router for navigation, and component-based architecture.


** Instructions:

*** 0001 - Layout
- Create an input box where users can type the name or ID of a Pokémon.
- Add a button that triggers the search when clicked.
- Use the PokeAPI to fetch Pokémon data asynchronously.
- When the search is triggered, make an API request to retrieve the Pokémon's information.

*** 0010 - Display Data
- Display the Pokémon's name and image on the page after fetching the data.
- Update the DOM dynamically based on the API response.

*** 0011 - Basic Error Handling
- If the Pokémon is not found, display a simple error message.

*** Bonus (Optional)
- Display the Pokémon's type (e.g., Fire, Water) along with its name and image.

*** Technical Requirements
- Use vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks).
- Fetch Pokémon data using the Fetch API or async/await.
- Dynamically update the DOM with the Pokémon data.
  
** Deliverables
- A working web page that allows users to search for a Pokémon and displays its name and image.

** Evaluation Criteria
- The app should successfully fetch and display Pokémon data.
- Clean and readable code.
- Simple, functional interface with appropriate feedback for invalid searches.
